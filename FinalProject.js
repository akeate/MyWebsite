    <h3>ERMC Aviation LLC (Summer 2021)</h3>
    <p>Duties: Responsible for cleaning and maintaining the appearance of the department's facility 
        and aircraft, collect trash, clean, scrub, vacuum, lavatories, and galleys, restock 
        supplies throughout aircraft and facility floor, perform security searches on aircraft; 
        inform the lead agent or supervisor of a security breach or unusual occurrence; follow 
        all airport, company and airline security procedures, and other duties assigned
    </p>
    <p>About the Job: This was my first job in the aviation industry that allowed me to work in the airport 
    and see first hand what happens in this work environment. It helped me to see all the regulations I study 
    and rules that I was unaware of to make the practical connection between what I am learning and what the jobs
    actually consist of. It also opened my eyes to some of the problems in the industry and what I think can be 
    improved, if and when I get a chance. This will hopefully be my first of many jobs related to aviation. 
    </p>

        inspected retreaded tires after they were reconstructed, stripped rusty truck rims, 
        powder coated rims and painted them, and organized palettes of rims with forklift.
    </p>
    <p>About the Job: This is a family business where I am able to try and help beyond my job title. I enjoyed 
    trying to solve problems on a bigger scale that helped the company in the short term, while also thinking 
    about the future. This job has taught me many valuable skills, while also working with some great coworkers, 
    where I hope to build a similar work environment for my future jobs.

    <h3>Two Men and a Truck (Summer 2019)</h3>
    <p>Thoroughly wrapped house items in protective covering, carefully carried items in and 
        out of the truck, and assisted customer with any other needs.
    </p>
    <p>About the Job: One of my shortest work experiences, but it taught me a lot being very close to management. 
    The job that has required the most teamwork and allowed me to see first hand just how important it is for 
    everyone to be on the same page. One key lesson that I learned in this job is that everyone must be working 
    together and if they are not the team will fail.

    </p>
    <p>About the Job: This was very enjoyable in that I was able to share and teach something that I know a lot 
    about to people that are trying to learn. In a scenario like this it was important for me to be patient and 
    help as much as I can. After doing this, it allowed me to look back on my experience and see how far some of 
    the players have come and that I was apart of their growth. I would definitely want to do this again if the 
    opportunity presents itself.

    <h3>Soccer</h3>
    <h4>Playing</h4>
    <p>
        I have been playing soccer since the age of 4 and have not found anything more fun to do. My dream was always to play 
        professional, but as time went on I realized how unrealistic it is. I have enjoyed turning my experience and knowledge of 
        the game into coaching others and playing at my right level. Growing up I have played for Chicago Fire Juniors academy, 
        Eclipse, Chicago Magic Academy, and Oak Brook Soccer Club. I typically play defence because I have good lateral movement, 
        am faster than most forwards, and it gives me more time to pass to teammates.
    </p>
    <h4>Watching</h4>
    <p>
        My favorite soccer team is Chelsea FC who play in the Premier League. When I was younger I went to London, England to their 
        stadium and ever since then they have been my favorite. If their game is after the sun rise, I make it a priority to watch the 
        game. 
    </p>

    <h3>Aviation</h3>
    <p>
        From a young age, I have always been interested in planes and as I got older, the entire industry intrigued me and I understood it 
        well. I have been studying it for four years and worked in it for one. From this experince I know that it is always changing and based 
        on the management I had when working, there is a lot of work for improvement and people to learn from. I hope to get a job at an airline 
        rather than an airport because of the different focuses of each of the options.
